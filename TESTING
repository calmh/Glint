Testing the application before release
======================================

* Start Glint, select screen two, verify that GPS signal is recieved, that
  the GPS signal indicator turns green and that the "signal OK" sound is
  played.

* Take a walk and verify that speed, course etc. are updated and seem
  reasonable.

* Start recording and verify that the recording indicator turns green and the
  number of recorded points increase.

* Pause Glint and verify that the GPS indicator turns grey to indicate
  disabled and that no updates occur.

* Unpause Glint and verify that the elapsed time starts counting from
  (approximately) the same time as before the pause, and that updates happen.

* Exit glint back to the springboard, and start it again. If the feature is
  enabled, it should continue recording and the number of recorded points
  should be the same as before exiting.

* Continue walking and check that lap times are correctly recorded.

* Stop recording.

* Enter the files view and verify that the newly recorded file is there.

* Mail the file to yourself.

* Check the lap times against what was said during the walk. They should be
  the same or very close.

* View the recorded track on the map. It should show your walk, with breaks
  where Glint was paused or not running.

* Stop Glint and start it again. Enter the files view, pick the newly
  recorded file and select it to be raced against. Verify that the racing
  indicator turns green, and the two bottom fields on screen one change to
  time and distance difference.

* Continue walking and check that time and distance difference updates and
  seems reasonable.
