Glint
=====

Glint is an iPhone application that does GPS tracking. That means it keeps
track of where you are and where you're going. It's potentially useful for
running, trekking, cycling, paddling, geocaching, geotagging, etc. You can
record tracks and export them as GPX, which is importable in a number of
mapping programs for different platforms.

The source code is released under a BSD license, which means you can fork it
and do pretty much what you want with it, but check LICENSE for the legalese
stuff.

You need to be a registered Apple developer to deploy the compiled binary to
the actual hardware platform, but you can always try it out in the simulator
without registering.

The latest "official" binary release is available for free in the App Store:
